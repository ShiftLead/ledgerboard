# The ledger and board formats — version 1

This is the formats' one definition in prose; `ledgerboard.py` is the one implementation and
`fixtures/` the cases any implementation must reproduce. Where this text and the module disagree,
the fixtures decide, and the disagreement is a bug here. *What to do* with a field — lanes,
routing, who may write what, when a sweep runs — is a consumer's, never the format's.

## The ledger

A ledger is a Markdown file (by convention `docs/technical_debt.md`) with an archive beside it
(`docs/technical_debt_archive.md`). HTML comments are not read: a seed's commented-out example
entry is not an entry.

**Entries.** An entry starts at a `## TD-NNN: title` heading and runs to the next `## ` heading of
any kind. `TD-` plus a number (zero-padded to three digits by convention), assigned in order, never
reused.

**The header block** is the entry's fields: the lines after the heading's blank lines, up to the
next blank line. Each `**Name:** value` line there is one field, on one line; a repeated field's
first wins. Names compare case- and separator-insensitively (`Blocked by`, `blocked-by`,
`BLOCKED_BY`). **A field's value is its first word**, lower-cased; the rest of the line is a free
comment. The format's own fields: `Priority` (High, Medium, Low), `Type` (debt — the default — or
feature), `Added`, `Status`, `Blocked by`, `Location`. A `Priority`, `Type` or `Blocked by` written
below the header block is still read, and flagged.

**`Fields:`** — a ledger may declare its own fields' vocabularies once, on one preamble line before
the first entry: `Fields: Owner = builder | designer; Kind = build | design-first`. A declared
field's value outside its vocabulary is an error; an undeclared field is read but not validated.
The format's own fields are never redeclared.

**`Blocked by`** — comma-separated items, each `TD-NNN` or `<repo>#TD-NNN` (another repo's
entry; `<repo>` a name or `owner/name`), then optionally `decision (<who>)` last, whose pointer
runs to the end of the line. **Pickable is derived, never written:** an entry is pickable when it
has no `Blocked by`, or every entry it names is archived and it names no decision. An item that
cannot be read, an entry in neither the ledger nor the archive, or another repo's entry the reader
cannot resolve keeps the block. A written `**Pickable:**` line is only a field.

**Pick order** is the rank (below): by card, then within a card by dependency, then by key. With
no rank file it is Priority (High, Medium, Low, then anything else), then Type (debt before feature),
then id order — except that a card moves as one, at its best member's key, so a prerequisite is
picked before the entries that wait on it.

**The summary table:** one `| TD-NNN | title | priority | status |` row per entry with a body in
the ledger, in pick order by intent.

**The archive** holds resolved entries, bodies whole, in the same shape.

**`Tracker:`** — an entry mapped from an outside tracker carries its id as `**Tracker:** ABC-123`.
Every edit keeps it byte for byte; what it links to is the importer's.

## The rank

The rank is a person's order of a ledger's entries; it is the pick order.

**Cards.** A ledger's entries fall into **cards**: the connected components of its entries over
their `Blocked by` ids (the ids before any `decision (…)`), joined in both directions
(`components()`); ids match by number, as a blocker does (`TD-7` is `TD-007`). An id an entry names that is not among the entries read — an archived or unknown
one — is listed with the card but is not a member and joins nothing; a `<repo>#TD-NNN` id is listed
for a caller to join cards across repos. The same rule reads an archive.

**Keys.** Every open entry has a key, a string compared character by character in code point order,
except that `|`, the separator, sorts below every other character (`key_order()`); a shorter key that
is a prefix of a longer one sorts first. A key starts with a letter or digit and holds letters,
digits, `|`, `_`, `.`, `/` and `-` (ASCII only). An entry's key is its line in the rank file when it has one,
else its **implicit key**: its Priority's band (`1` High, `2` Medium, `3` Low, `4` anything else), its
Type's index in pick order (`0` debt, `1` feature), its id number zero-padded to six digits, and, where
a caller orders entries of several repos together, the repo's name — joined by `|`
(`2|0|000642|shiftlead`; `implicit_key()`). Two undragged neighbours always have room between them.
`midpoint(a, b)` returns a key strictly between two keys, either end open (None); it writes digits
and lower-case letters after a shared prefix (a `|` only where nothing else fits) and never ends a
key in `0`, so there is room again. It refuses keys out of order and a pair with no key between
them — `a` against `a` followed by `|`s alone, or nothing against `0` (a key starts with a letter or
digit, so none sorts below `0`).

**A card's key** is the best (lowest) key among its members that have a line, when any has one,
else the best implicit key among them. So a card the person placed keeps its place: a Priority edit
on a lined card moves nothing, and a member added later takes the card's key. Cards sort by key,
ties by their lowest id; within a card an entry comes after every member it is blocked by, then by
its own key (a cycle is broken by key).

**The rank file** is named from the ledger's path: `<ledger stem>_rank.yml` beside it
(`docs/technical_debt_rank.yml`; `rank_path()`), with no setting of its own. Its grammar: `#`
comment lines first, then one line per entry, `TD-NNN: <key>`, sorted by key; nothing else. It is
YAML-shaped but read only through `rank()`, which takes every key as a string (`09` is a key, not a
number). The reader flags a line it cannot read and a repeated id (⚠, the first line holds), and a
blank line, a comment below the first entry, or a line out of key order (ℹ). The writer
(`set_rank()`) sets or removes the given ids' lines, places a new line at its key's place, and keeps
every other line byte for byte (a new line takes the file's own line ending). A line for an archived entry is ignored — only open members carry a
card's key — and harmless until its card is wholly archived.

**Rank writes** are made by a tool, each in a commit (and PR) that changes the rank file alone,
under a subject `queue: <action> TD-a, TD-b (<tool>)` (`queue_subject()`, ids in id order):
`rank` sets a moved card's members' lines, `join` gives a card's newcomer the card's key, `prune`
removes the lines of a card whose members are all archived. `subject_kind()` reads every one as
`queue`.

## The board

A board is a Markdown file (by convention `docs/user_attention.md`) of items for a person.

**An item** is one line: `- [ ] [kind] YYYY-MM-DD (session <name> on <host>, or n/a) — text.
Context: … Due: YYYY-MM-DD.` A closed item is ticked: `- [x] … Closed: YYYY-MM-DD — why.` Items
are never deleted; closed ones are archived in bulk once ten or more sit on the board. When an open
item and a closed one have the same key (below), the item is closed: a merge kept both sides.

**The head** — `(session <name> on <host>…)`, either name optionally backticked; the session is the
first name, the host the first word after ` on ` inside the parentheses; `n/a` names nothing.

**Kind** — one optional word before the date: `decide`, `act`, `look`, `watch`, `fyi`. Only a word
followed by a date is a kind. `decide`, `act`, `look` and no word are the person's to-do; `watch` is
a re-check whose check-by date is its `Due:`; `fyi` is never due (a `Due:` on one is ignored, and
flagged).

**`Due:`** — `Due: YYYY-MM-DD`; an item's first `Due:` is its date. A date-shaped token the reader
cannot read (`Due: 2026-1-9`) is reported, never silently undated.

**`Context:`** — what the item refers to, read as refs in order: `TD-NNN` or `<repo>#TD-NNN`,
`PR #N` (`PRs #12/#13` and `PR #12, #13` give both), and best-effort `branch <name>`.

**Trailing fields**, after the `Due:` when there is one, each starting a sentence and anchored to the
line's end, in this order:
- `Answers: a | b (default).` — the proposed answers, `\|` for a literal bar; at most one marked
  ` (default)`, the asker's recommendation. A `look` carries exactly `Answers: Works | Not right: <what>.`
  Its second answer is a **form**, whose slot is the person's words: an offered answer is the form when
  it is `Not right:` alone or followed by one `<…>` placeholder (whitespace collapsed, case as written);
  `Not right: wrong repo` is a complete answer like any other. An answer given to a form fills it when
  it starts `Not right:` and is not itself the form — one that adds nothing, or only a placeholder, is refused.
- `Decided: <text> (YYYY-MM-DD).` — the person's answer. A decided item stays open and due; it now
  waits on whoever acts on it, not on the person.

**The bold head** — an item's first `**…**` run, whitespace collapsed, read outside its replies'
words (its fields' are read: a bold answer with no bold before it is the head), is its title where it
has one. A blank run (`** **`) is none. A line with none has no bold head; what stands in for it is the
consumer's.

**Replies** — ` — <name>, YYYY-MM-DD: <words>` after the `Due:` and ahead of the trailing fields,
any number in a row. A reply's words never carry `Context:`, `Answers:`, `Decided:` or `Closed:`,
nor a `Due:` on an item that has none.

**The detail block** — the lines right under an item indented deeper than its `-`, up to a blank
line, a line no deeper, or another item. No edit touches it.

**The item key** — the line with the tick, `Closed:`, `Decided:`, `Due:` and the reply tails taken
out, indentation kept. It is what makes an open and a closed copy of one item, or a snoozed or
replied-to one, equal. **Consumers persist keys, so what the key is for a given line is part of
the format: changing it is a new major version.**

**Preamble lines** — `Name: value` lines before the items (`Kinds:`, `Format:`, a dated stamp
`Name: YYYY-MM-DD (…)`) are kept byte for byte by every edit. Which stamps a consumer writes and
what they mean are the consumer's.

## Edits

Every edit rewrites one open item line and nothing else, and is refused unless the reader reads
back exactly what was meant:
- **snooze** sets the item's `Due:` (adding one ahead of the trailing fields when it has none);
- **done** ticks it and appends `Closed: YYYY-MM-DD[ — why].`;
- **decide** writes `Decided: <answer> (YYYY-MM-DD).`, replacing an earlier one;
- **reply** appends a reply tail.

A new item (`item_line(text, due, today, session, host, context)`) is composed as `- [ ] <today> (session `<name>` on <host>, or n/a) — <text>. Context:
<about>. Due: <date>.`; an answer given elsewhere (on a ledger entry) as an already decided `decide`
item with `(person)` as its head.

**The commit subject of a board write** is one line: `<tool>: <action> <head>[ to <date> | :
<answer>] (session <name>)` for the four edits, and `<tool>: append <head> (session <name>)` for a
new item — the head is the item's text after its prefix, before its fields, bold dropped, at most
60 characters; a reply's words never appear. Subjects written before v1 by one consumer
(`shiftlead: board|answer <head> (from <ref>)`, `shiftlead: board decide <ref> (person)`) still
read as appends.
`subject_kind()` names a subject `edit`, `append` or (a rank write, above) `queue`.

## Versions

A ledger or board may declare its major version on a preamble line, `Ledgerboard: 1`; none means 1.
A reader that meets a newer major than it knows reads nothing and says so (`version_problem()`, which a consumer calls before it trusts what it parsed — no parser calls it for you). A release of the module
is `v<major>.<minor>`: a minor release reads every file the major's earlier releases wrote.
