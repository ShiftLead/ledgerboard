The board is a v3 directory of item files (``--board`` the directory, or the stub beside it); ``list`` and ``show``
also read a v2 board file, and every write refuses one. Every write reads the board (``load_board()``), applies the
module's edit (``item_file``, ``decided_file``, ``edit_item``, ``canonical_item_file``, ``set_rank``), and writes the
files back, all or none: ``done``, and a ``decide`` that closes, write the item's archived file
(``archive/<YYYY-MM>/<id>.md``) and remove its open one. A write prints the commit subject the module gives and the
paths it changed (``--json``: one object, naming the item's ``id``); ``--plan`` prints the changes as JSON (each path
with its new text, or null for a removal) and writes nothing. It never runs git, the network or anything of a
consumer's: the caller passes who replies or answers (``--by``), the date (``--today``, default the local clock), the
id (``add --id``, else drawn at random) and the tool and session the subject names, and makes the commit itself. A
write that leaves an open item (``add``, ``snooze``, ``due``, ``decide``, ``reply``) also reports its notes
(``item_notes()`` at ``--today``): ``item_notes`` in ``--json`` and ``--plan``, and on stderr as ``<id>: ℹ <note>``
otherwise; a note never changes the exit code. A ``decide --board-only`` whose lifting answer leaves a listed entry
still carrying the gate writes nothing (v2.7): it reports ``left_open`` and prints ``left open: <ids> still carry
<gate>`` on stderr in every mode.

Exit, the package's one table (``ledger.py`` shares it): 0 written (or nothing to change); 1 refused; 2 usage
(a bad ``--today`` among it), or (``decide`` and ``add --parts``) the ledger cannot be used as asked; 4 a write failed (every file restored). 3 is ``ledger.py``'s
``needs`` and never the board writer's.
